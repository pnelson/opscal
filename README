OpsCal
======

A former workplace was manually generating their shift work calendar in Excel
every year. The schedule followed a simple pattern and I was interested in
trying out some Android development so this is what I came up with on my own
time. Though the exact implementation may not be reusable, I think this project
is a good example Android application.
